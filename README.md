# Competitive Analysis App - Blue Ocean Strategy

This application is designed to facilitate competitive analysis using the principles of Blue Ocean Strategy by Ren√©e Mauborgne and W. Chan Kim. The app allows users to input and visualize the competitive landscape of their business compared to their competitors based on various features.

## Features

The app includes the following sections:

### 1. Company Information
- **Your Company Name**: A text input field where the user enters the name of their company.

### 2. Competitor Information
- **List of Competitors**: Three text input fields (C1, C2, C3) where the user enters the names of their competitors.

### 3. Competitive Features
- **List of Features (excluding price)**: 
  - Five text input fields (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) to enter the key competitive features that will be used to compare companies.
  - **Price** is automatically included as the first feature.

### 4. Score Matrix for Competitors
- A dynamic table where users score each competitor based on the features (including Price) from 0 to 100. 
  - **Rows** represent competitors (C1, C2, C3).
  - **Columns** represent Price and the user-defined competitive features (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5).

#### Example:

| Competitor | Price | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Feature 4 | Feature 5 |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| C1         | 90    | 75        | 60        | 80        | 70        | 85        |
| C2         | 80    | 65        | 50        | 70        | 60        | 75        |
| C3         | 85    | 70        | 55        | 75        | 65        | 80        |

### 5. Data Submission and Visualization
- **Save Button**: Once all the fields are filled, the user clicks the "Save" button to save the data and move to the visualization page.
- **Graphical Representation**: Redirects to another page that displays the score matrix as a line chart using the ApexCharts library.
  - **X-axis**: List of competitors (C1, C2, C3).
  - **Y-axis**: Features (Price, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5).
  - The graph shows a multi-series line chart with data points corresponding to the scores entered.
